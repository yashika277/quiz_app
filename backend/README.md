Features: Create, retrieve, and manage quizzes. Submit user answers for a quiz. Automatically calculate the user's score based on correct answers. Validations for quiz creation and user responses. Centralized error handling for consistent responses.

Validations Quiz Creation Validation In routes/quizRoutes.js, the quiz creation endpoint ensures:

The quiz has a title. Each question has a question text, at least two options, and a correctAnswer. User Response Validation In routes/userResponseRoutes.js, the response submission endpoint ensures:

The quizId, userName, and responses fields are provided. Each response has a valid questionId and a selectedOption.

Error Handling A centralized error handler is implemented in app.js to catch and respond to any errors that occur during request processing. If any validation fails or an invalid quiz/question is referenced, the API responds with a structured error message, including details about what went wrong.
